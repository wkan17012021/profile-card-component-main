## Overview

This is an interesting challenge as it appears to be a common feature amongst online profiles. The aim was to again maintain proficiency with the reproduction of the template.

### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided

## My process

- Use a similar layout process as before- box model for the outer container, a div or section for the upper background image.
- Position relative for the central profile photo, then trial and error margin settings for the main text beneath. This seems like a "hacky" way to do this, perhaps there is a cleaner process.
- Background overlay with trial and error for the positioning.
- Flex for the stats / social media details.

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Conscious of overrunning time for this challenge. Need to research how to fine-tune the background pattern so that it can be rendered as per the template. Possibly a combination of background-repeat/position/size properties. Also, the positioning of the circle photo I feel is perhaps not the conventional way of rendering this feature- perhaps some combination of margins (negative?) and z-index.
Finally, the responsiveness is a bit jarring, still working on a way to improve this.

### Continued development

- Learn to manipulate background properties styling.
- Learn how the profile photo is typically rendered.

### Useful resources

- The odd stack overflow query and W3 consultation.
